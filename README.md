A brief overview: **GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, and enables powerful developer tools. The [specification](https://spec.graphql.org/) is open source and governed by the [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).
