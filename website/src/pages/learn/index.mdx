GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your
data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type.
For example, a GraphQL service that tells you who the logged in user is (`me`) as well as that user's name might look
like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

Along with functions for each field on each type:

```js
function Query_me(request) {
  return request.auth.user
}

function User_name(user) {
  return user.getName()
}
```

After a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can receive GraphQL queries to validate and execute.
The service first checks a query to ensure it only refers to the types and fields defined, and then runs the provided functions
to produce a result.

For example, the query:

```graphql
{
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

Could produce the following JSON result:

```json
{
  "me": {
    "name": "Luke Skywalker"
  }
}
```
