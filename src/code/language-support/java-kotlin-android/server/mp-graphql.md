MicroProfile GraphQL is a GraphQL server and client specification for building GraphQL applications. It's unique
annotation-based API approach enables rapid application development. Applications coded to the MP GraphQL APIs are
portable, and can be deployed into Java server runtimes such as [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/),
[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), [Helidon](https://helidon.io/) and [Wildfly](https://www.wildfly.org/). This means that
your applications can make use of other [Jakarta](https://jakarta.ee/) and [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)
technologies.

MP GraphQL features include:

- Annotation-based APIs
- Integration with Jakarta CDI
- Type-safe and dynamic client APIs
- Exception handling
- Easy integration with Jakarta and MicroProfile technologies
