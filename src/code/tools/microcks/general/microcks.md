Microcks is a platform for turning your API and microservices assets - _GraphQL schemas_, _OpenAPI specs_, _AsyncAPI specs_, _gRPC protobuf_, _Postman collections_, _SoapUI projects_\_ - into live simulations in seconds.

It also reuses these assets for running compliance and non-regression tests against your API implementation. We provide integrations with _Jenkins_, _GitHub Actions_, _Tekton_ and many others through a simple CLI.
