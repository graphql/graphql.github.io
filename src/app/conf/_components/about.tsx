              GraphQLConf – is the official conference produced by the GraphQL
              Foundation that brings together the global community of GraphQL
              developers, leaders and innovators to further the education,
              adoption and advancement of GraphQL implementations in the
              industry.

            <p>
              In the 8 years of GraphQL being around, we have seen adoption
              across some of the largest organizations globally with homegrown
              implementations, open source tooling and several vendor solutions
              that have enabled the ease of adoption, implementation and
              management of GraphQL.
