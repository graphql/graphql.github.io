The GraphQL Spring Boot turns any Spring Boot application into a GraphQL Server

Started includes features such as:

- Use a schema-driven API with the help of [GraphQL Java Tools](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools)
- Optionally choose to use an annotation driven schema with the help of [GraphQL-Java Annotations](https://github.com/Enigmatis/graphql-java-annotations)
- Embedded [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) tool for schema introspection and query debugging
- Embedded [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) tool for schema introspection and query debugging
- Embedded the [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) tool to represent your GraphQL API as an interactive graph
