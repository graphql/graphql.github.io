1.  SpringBoot has introduced Spring GraphQL since 2.7. Jimmer provides specialized API for rapid development of Spring GraphQL-based applications.

2.  Support two APIs: Java API & kotlin API.

3.  Powerful and GraphQL friendly caching support.

4.  Faster than other popular ORM solutions, please see the bechmark: https://babyfish-ct.github.io/jimmer/docs/benchmark/

5.  More powerful than other popular ORM solutions.

    Three aspects should be considered in ORM design:

    a. Query.
    b. Update.
    c. Cache.

    Each aspect is aimed at object trees with arbitrary depth rather than simple objects. This distinctive design brings convenience unmatched by other popular solutions.
