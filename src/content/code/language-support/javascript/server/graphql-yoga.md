```

Then create a server using the `createServer` import:

```js
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello Hello Hello',
      },
    },
  },
})

server.start()
```

Depending on your deployment target, you may need to use an additional library. See the [documentation](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs) for further details.
