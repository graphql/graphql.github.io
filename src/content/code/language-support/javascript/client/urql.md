`urql` is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.
It's built to be highly customisable and versatile so you can take it from getting started with your first GraphQL project
all the way to building complex apps and experimenting with GraphQL clients.

- Currently supports React, React Native, Preact, Svelte, and Vue, and is supported by GraphQL Code Generator.
- Logical yet simple default behaviour and document caching, and normalized caching via `@urql/exchange-graphcache`
- Fully customizable behaviour via "exchanges" (addon packages)
