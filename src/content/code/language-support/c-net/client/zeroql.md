The ZeroQL is a high-performance C#-friendly GraphQL client. It supports Linq-like syntax, and doesn't require Reflection.Emit or expressions.
As a result, at runtime provides performance very close to a raw HTTP call.

You can use ZeroQL to:

- Generate a C# client from GraphQL schema.
- Generate and execute graphql queries from your C# code.
- Don't require writing GraphQL manually.

```csharp
var response = await client.Query(o => o.Me(o => new { o.Id, o.FirstName, o.LastName }));
```
