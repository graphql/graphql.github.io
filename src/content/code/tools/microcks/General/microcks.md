Microcks is a platform for turning your API and microservices assets - *GraphQL schemas*, *OpenAPI specs*, *AsyncAPI specs*, *gRPC protobuf*, *Postman collections*, *SoapUI projects*_ - into live simulations in seconds.

It also reuses these assets for running compliance and non-regression tests against your API implementation. We provide integrations with *Jenkins*, *GitHub Actions*, *Tekton* and many others through a simple CLI.
