description: Apache APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway providing rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, observability, etc. As a cloud-native API gateway, Apache APISIX already can support GraphQL syntax at the beginning of its design. Efficiently matching GraphQL statements carried in requests can filter out abnormal traffic to further ensure security.
