## WHO WE ARE

The [GraphQL Foundation](/) is a neutral foundation created by the founders of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), along with many organizations who are using GraphQL in production. The GraphQL Foundation encourages contributions, stewardship, and a shared investment by providing vendor-neutral events, documentation, tools, and support for GraphQL.

## CULTIVATING PROJECTS

The GraphQL Foundation hosts the [GraphQL specification](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec), [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation, [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) library, and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) developer tool.

GraphQL is a next­-generation API technology developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly [open sourced in 2015](https://code.fb.com/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/). Unlike REST-­based APIs, which take advantage of HTTP and existing protocols, GraphQL APIs provide developers with the flexibility to query the exact data they need from a diverse set of cloud data sources, with less code, greater performance and security, and a faster development cycle. Not only does this enable developers to rapidly build top­ quality apps, it also helps them achieve consistency and feature parity across multiple platforms such as web, iOS, Android, and embedded and IoT applications.

The GraphQL Foundation also funded community member Ivan Goncharov to work through a variety of GraphQL project issues, from backlog cleanup and more.

### HOW OUR MEMBERS ARE USING GRAPHQL

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0 20px;"><img src="/img/report/expedia-group.svg" style="width: 200px; max-height: 150px;" alt="Expedia Group logo" ></div>

**Expedia Group** continues to rapidly adopt GraphQL. Over the last 2 years we have transitioned our REST APIs to GraphQL – and now over 90% of all customer interactions in web and native[vrbo.com](http://vrbo.com/) apps are powered by GraphQL APIs and over 30% of all customer interactions on Expedia.com as well as other brands such as Hotels.com.

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0 20px;"><img src="/img/report/facebook.svg" style="width: 200px; max-height: 150px;" alt="Facebook logo" ></div>

**Facebook** has used GraphQL to power our production mobile apps for the last 7.5 years, from its creation as an internal API in 2012 to its open sourcing in 2015 and beyond. In 2020, we’re as invested in the community and the technology as ever — we’re [discussing our approach to streaming semantics with the GraphQL working group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/329), and we’re [powering the new Facebook.com with GraphQL and Relay](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/).

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0 20px;"><img src="/img/report/novvum.svg" style="width: 200px; max-height: 150px;" alt="Novvum logo" ></div>

**Novvum** had been deploying graphql into production for the majority of our customers since its inception back in 2015. On any project, we find it extremely beneficial to add GraphQL as the primary communication layer between clients and the data that they need. From building car-sharing platforms on a time crunch to architecting fintech infrastructure to scaffolding MVPs for early-stage startups, we've observed many short- and long-term benefits by introducing GraphQL.

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0 20px;"><img src="/img/report/paypal.svg" style="width: 200px; max-height: 150px;" alt="PayPal logo" ></div>

**PayPal** uses GraphQL to power many of our products and user experiences including PayPal Checkout, our flagship product that facilitates payments for millions of merchants and users.

## TRAINING

The GraphQL Foundation is proud to offer a new, free course – [Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language for APIs](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-graphql) – through [edX](https://www.edx.org/) which we have had thousands already sign up for.

If you are a programmer, this course will help you gain the skills you need to get started using GraphQL for a small project, or professionally in production. We cover a variety of tools to address multiple use cases.

If you are nontechnical, this course will help you communicate with developers and participate in conversations about GraphQL, and understand when and why to use GraphQL for a project.

## COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

Want to start a meetup? Drop us a line, we’d love to hear your idea: info@graphql.org.

## GRAPHQL LANDSCAPE

The [GraphQL Interactive Landscape](https://landscape.graphql.org/) was recently published by the GraphQL Foundation.

![GraphQL Landscape](https://landscape.graphql.org/images/landscape.png)

What is an interactive landscape? The concept started when the CNCF began the process of cataloging different types of tools for building out a cloud native architecture. This led to the creation of the CNCF Interactive Landscape. Turns out this tool became very helpful to all of us sorting out this new and exciting space. In the interest of providing a similar reference, the GraphQL Foundation defined their own version of the interactive landscape, including also adopters of GraphQL technology.

The landscape is open source, and contributions from the community are welcomed. You can find guidelines for updating the landscape at: [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-landscape](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-landscape).

## DEVSTATS

The [DevStats](https://github.com/cncf/devstats) tool, which is open source, downloads data representing every public GitHub action across GraphQL Foundation projects and stores it in a queryable [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. DevStats downloads updated data every hour and you can check out the tool here: [https://devstats.graphql.org](https://devstats.graphql.org/)

## A LOOK AHEAD TO 2020

As the Executive Director of the GraphQL project, I hope I can speak for the whole community when I say we are looking forward to another productive year of GraphQL development. We are putting the final touches on the GraphQL 2020 spec release, and continue to make great progress developing new features, stabilizing existing ones, and exploring beyond core GraphQL.

It has been really encouraging to see GraphQL continue to evolve over the past year as a technology and as a community. GraphQL is being used at scale by not only Facebook but now a great number of organizations large and small. As I said when first introducing the project, GraphQL is unapologetically driven by the needs of the client. This has been a critical aspect of GraphQL's success and it is great to see this principle reflect itself in our community, where those more interested in consuming APIs than producing them have come together to support the ongoing sustainability of the project.

Since establishing the GraphQL Foundation, we've had an outpouring of support from these companies. This neutral, non-profit home for the GraphQL project has provided a healthy way for users, contributors, and supporters to collaborate and contribute funding in support of our programs and collaborative processes. For example, this support has enabled us to support long-time contributor Ivan Goncharov to focus on crucial development and maintenance of the reference implementation, specification and other community gardening work. It has also allowed us to launch a free GraphQL edX course, and has enabled us to take some first steps toward supporting and producing community events.

Development of the GraphQL spec has remained open to all contributors. Over the last year we've brought more rigor and clarity to the development process. I've found it encouraging that contributions have been a healthy mix of aspirational new features and iterative improvements to the stable base. This demonstrates that GraphQL is evolving in meaningful ways to address exciting new use cases while also building confidence and stability around what thousands of companies use in production every day. Both of these are essential for GraphQL's long term success.

Looking ahead, I have great optimism for GraphQL and see huge opportunities. First, we've been hard at work on the 2020 spec and that release is imminent. Spec development continues to accelerate and exciting advancements and improvements are underway for the 2021 release and beyond. Second, we have been accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code and are looking forward to adding these talented students as project collaborators. Third, the communities around the core GraphQL project are collaborating. For example, GraphiQL and Playground recently announced they will be joining efforts to build better tools for us all.

Thank you again for your involvement in this project and your support of the GraphQL Foundation. I am pleased with our progress and am looking forward to another productive year.

_– Lee Byron, Executive Director, GraphQL Foundation, and GraphQL Co-Creator_
