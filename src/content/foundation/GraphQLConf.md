By the community and for the community, GraphQLConf is a vendor-neutral event that brings together core contributors, community members, open source leaders, academics, vendors, and industry practitioners to discuss recent work, share techniques, and plan for the future.

## GraphQLConf 2023

We're looking forward to [GraphQLConf 2023](/conf/) in SF Bay Area, CA on September 19-21, 2023.

## GraphQLConf 2022

The GraphQL Foundation's inaugural GraphQL Conf was co-located with [OpenJS World](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openjs-world/) and [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/) in Austin, TX on June 7-8, 2022. This collaborator summit-style event provided an opportunity for core GraphQL spec and implementation developers to meet in-person, discuss recent work, and plan for the future. All attendees of OpenJS World and cdCon were welcome.

Talks covered:

- Recent activity in the GraphQL specification working group, such as Defer and Stream, Input Unions, and Client-Controlled Nullability.
- Downstream implementations of GraphQL
- Security considerations
- Common practices and lessons learned

Recordings of the sessions are available on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.graphql.org).
