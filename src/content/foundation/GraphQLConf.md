The GraphQL Foundation's inaugural GraphQL Conf was co-located with [OpenJS World](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openjs-world/) and [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/) in Austin, TX on June 7-8, 2022. This collaborator summit-style event provided an opportunity for core GraphQL spec and implementation developers to meet in-person, discuss recent work, and plan for the future. All attendees of OpenJS World and cdCon were welcome.

Talks covered:

* Recent activity in the GraphQL specification working group, such as Defer and Stream, Input Unions, and Client-Controlled Nullability.
* Downstream implementations of GraphQL
* Security considerations
* Common practices and lessons learned

Recordings of the sessions are available on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.graphql.org).
