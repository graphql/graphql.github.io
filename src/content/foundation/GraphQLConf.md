The GraphQL Foundation's inaugural [GraphQL Conf](https://conf.graphql.org) will be co-located with [OpenJS World](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openjs-world/) and [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/) in Austin, TX on June 7-9, 2022. This collaborator summit-style event will be an opportunity for core GraphQL spec and implementation developers to meet in-person, discuss recent work, and plan for the future. All attendees of OpenJS World and cdCon are welcome.

Talks are expected to include:

* Recent activity in the GraphQL specification working group, such as Defer and Stream, Input Unions, and Client-Controlled Nullability.
* Downstream implementations of GraphQL
* Security considerations
* Common practices and lessons learned

For those who cannot attend, we will be recording the sessions and posting them to [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.graphql.org).

GraphQL Conf will be held in a shared space. To join us, please register for [OpenJS World](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openjs-world/) or [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/).
