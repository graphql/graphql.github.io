## What is the best way to follow specification releases?

The latest working draft release of the GraphQL specification can be found at [spec.graphql.org/draft](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/). Previous editions are also available at permalinks that match their [release tag](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/releases).

## How can I contribute to the GraphQL specification?

GraphQL is still evolving and contributions are very welcome! The specification (including the [latest working draft](https://spec.graphql.org/)) is open source. [Contributor guidelines](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are available on GitHub.

There are more ways to get involved with GraphQL beyond the specification though. Updating the content on [this website and the documentation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io), for example. Or contributing to [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), or [one of the many other projects](https://github.com/graphql/) maintained by the [GraphQL Foundation](#what-is-the-graphql-foundation).

## Where is the documentation for subscriptions?

It's not on this website yet, but we're working on it. If you'd like to help create these guides, please [let us know](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/issues/new). 

For now, the specification includes details for [how to write and execute subscriptions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Subscription).
