## Where to ask questions

### Stack Overflow

Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to ask and answer questions. If you're running into an implementation issue or having trouble with a query, this is the best place to start.

[Read through the existing questions tagged with **graphql** or ask your own!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/graphql)

### Live discussion

Many GraphQL developers idle in Discord, Slack, and IRC for live
communication and can answer quick questions.

Please be patient and polite. These are not explicitly user support channels, although they're likely a good place to find someone who can answer your question if you ask nicely.
