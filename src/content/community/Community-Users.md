The following resources are intended to help users and implementers. Find something useful? Please add it to the list!

*Please note that the GraphQL Foundation does not provide support or services, and cannot recommend one vendor's product over another.*

## Training courses

A number of GraphQL training courses are available.

* [Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language For APIs](https://www.edx.org/course/exploring-graphql-a-query-language-for-apis): A free 7 week edX course, developed by [Linux Foundation Training](https://training.linuxfoundation.org)
* [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com): The Fullstack Tutorial for GraphQL
* [Apollo Odyssey](https://apollographql.com/tutorials/): Interactive courses for building GraphQL applications with Apollo's toolset

## Where to ask questions

### Stack Overflow

Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to ask and answer questions. If you're running into an implementation issue or having trouble with a query, this is the best place to start.

[Read through the existing questions tagged with **graphql** or ask your own!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/graphql)

### Live discussion

Many GraphQL developers idle in Discord, Slack, and IRC for live
communication and can answer quick questions.

Please be patient and polite. These are not explicitly user support channels, although they're likely a good place to find someone who can answer your question if you ask nicely.

* [GraphQL Foundation Discord](https://discord.graphql.org)
  * We're in the process of moving our official chat to Discord, but you may find historical discussion in ~~[#general on the GraphQL Slack](https://graphql.slack.com/messages/general/) [(Get an invite)](https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/)~~.
* [GraphQL Community Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/graphql.community/)
