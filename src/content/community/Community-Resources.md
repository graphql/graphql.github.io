## GraphQL Trademark

The GraphQL name and logo are registered trademarks, and are neutrally held by The Linux Foundation. You may use the GraphQL mark so long as you adhere to the [trademark policy](https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/).

### Artwork

The GraphQL assets are available in the [artwork repo](https://github.com/graphql/artwork).

## Code of conduct

The [GraphQL Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct/) applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
