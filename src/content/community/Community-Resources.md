## Community Grant program

The [GraphQL Foundation](/foundation) funds a [Community Grant](/foundation/community-grant/) program that is administered by the [GraphQL TSC](/community/developers/#technical-governance). The goal of the community grant program is to provide support to individuals working on initiatives that benefit the core technical project and the community at large.

## GraphQL Logo & Trademark

The GraphQL name and logo are registered trademarks, and are neutrally held by The Linux Foundation. You may use the GraphQL mark so long as you adhere to the [trademark policy](https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/).

Download the GraphQL logo and find guidelines for its use in the [brand guidelines](/brand).

## Code of conduct

The [GraphQL Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct/) applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
