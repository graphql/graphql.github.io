We are thrilled to announce that Jovi De Croock [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) has been approved as a co-maintainer of GraphQL.js!
Jovi brings a wealth of experience and a deep passion for the GraphQL ecosystem, making him an invaluable addition to the team.

GraphQL.js is a fundamental library in the GraphQL ecosystem, serving as the reference implementation of the GraphQL specification.
It provides essential building blocks for defining GraphQL schemas, executing queries, and validating data, making it a critical tool for developers building GraphQL APIs in JavaScript/TypeScript and acting as the backbone of many GraphQL-based applications and services.
As the reference implementation, it aids anyone wishing to implement GraphQL in another programming language.
These roles make GraphQL.js pivotal in driving the adoption and evolution of GraphQL technology across the web development community.

The GraphQL.js maintainers ensure the project's health by managing contributions, reviewing code, addressing issues, and guiding its evolution alongside the GraphQL specification.
The maintainer role is vital in ensuring the quality, security, and relevance of the software, fostering a collaborative environment, and engaging with the community.

Please join us in welcoming Jovi De Croock to the GraphQL.js team, and join us for an upcoming [GraphQL.js Working Group meeting](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/blob/main/README.md)!
