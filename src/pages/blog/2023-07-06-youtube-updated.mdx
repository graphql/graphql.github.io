Have you been missing out on recent GraphQL Working Group meetings? Want to catch up on the latest conversations about Incremental Delivery, GraphQL over HTTP, and Input Unions?
Thanks to [Benjie Gillam](https://github.com/benjie), now you can!

Benjie has done the onerous job of updating the GraphQL Foundation’s YouTube playlists with all the latest recordings of GraphQL Working Group meetings, which are now available for you to view here: https://youtube.com/@GraphQLFoundation/playlists

GraphQL technical working group meetings are open to the public, and can be found on our calendar at https://calendar.graphql.org. Community members can subscribe to the whole calendar or to a specific meeting series for personal updates. For those who can’t make it, we encourage you to [subscribe to the YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@GraphQLFoundation) to get notified when working group meetings are posted.
