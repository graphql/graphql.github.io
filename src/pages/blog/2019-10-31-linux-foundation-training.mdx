[The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/), the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced enrollment is now open for a new, free, course – [Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language for APIs](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-graphql). This course is offered through [edX](https://www.edx.org/), the trusted platform for learning.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is revolutionizing the way developers are building APIs for web, mobile and even databases. But what exactly is GraphQL? GraphQL is an open source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

This course explains what GraphQL is and why it is getting so much attention from software engineers. It covers the advantages over REST, what types of software architectures to use it with, and why it benefits both frontend and backend developers. The student practices GraphQL queries in an interactive playground, and learns advanced topics such as how to implement a GraphQL server on the backend, how to use a GraphQL server with a client, and how to keep the GraphQL server secure. The course content was originally created by [Prisma](https://prisma.io), and updated and maintained by [Novvum](https://novvum.io).

"Since open sourcing GraphQL, I have been blown away by the growth of the technology and community. I'm excited to see the introduction of more educational material which I hope will help our community continue to grow and reach developers world-wide." – _Lee Byron, Executive Director, GraphQL Foundation, and GraphQL Co-Creator_

This course will help programmers gain the skills needed to use GraphQL for a small project or professionally in production. They will feel comfortable getting started with the right tools for their use case.

For the nontechnical person, this course will help them improve communication with developers and to participate in conversations about GraphQL. They will understand when and why to use GraphQL for a project.

[Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language for APIs](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-graphql) is available at no cost, with content access for up to 7 weeks. Learners may upgrade to the verified track for $99, which includes all graded assessments, unlimited access to the course content and the ability to earn a Verified Certificate upon passing the course.
