We are thrilled to announce a new co-maintainer of GraphQL.js: Yaacov Rydzinski [@Yaacov Rydzinski](https://github.com/yaacovCR) has been approved as a co-maintainer of GraphQL.js! 

Yaacovâ€™s journey into open source and GraphQL is unique, having earned degrees in both Medicine and Computer Science. Whereas most maintainers are employed as software developers, Yaacov is a technical radiologist by day and star GraphQL contributor by night. Yaacov brings real-world, end-user experience building APIs and tools for the medical field - sounds like a superhero to us! 

GraphQL.js is a fundamental library in the GraphQL ecosystem, serving as the reference implementation of the GraphQL specification in JavaScript. It provides the essential building blocks for defining GraphQL schemas, executing queries, and validating data, making it a critical tool for developers building GraphQL APIs. As the backbone of many GraphQL-based applications and services, GraphQL.js plays a pivotal role in driving the adoption and evolution of GraphQL technology across the web development community.

The GraphQL.js maintainers ensure the project's health by managing contributions, reviewing code, addressing issues, and guiding its evolution. Their role is vital in maintaining the quality, security, and relevance of the software, fostering a collaborative environment, and engaging with the community. 

Please join us in welcoming Yaacov to the GraphQL.js team, and join us for an upcoming [GraphQL.js Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg?tab=readme-ov-file#subcommittee-meetings) meeting!
