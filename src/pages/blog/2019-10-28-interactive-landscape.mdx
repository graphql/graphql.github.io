[The GraphQL Foundation](/), a neutral home for the GraphQL community to accelerate development of the surrounding ecosystem, today announced seven new members to support the Foundation's efforts, along with the launch of the [GraphQL Landscape](https://landscape.graphql.org).

The GraphQL Landscape is a dynamically generated tool designed to help explore the burgeoning GraphQL community of projects, adopters and member organizations. Currently, it is comprised of 100+ cards representing a market cap of more than $3.4T.

"When we first created GraphQL, we set out to make product development easier with APIs driven by the needs of mobile and app developers and dramatic simplifications of how APIs are built and maintained," said Lee Byron, Director of the GraphQL Foundation. "I'm thrilled to see this influx of multi-industry support for GraphQL and a commitment to increase developer productivity, showcased throughout the impressive and growing landscape."

"I'm thrilled to help launch the GraphQL Foundation's first landscape, displaying GraphQL's vast range of projects, adopters and members," said Chris Aniszczyk, VP of Developer Relations and CTO of CNCF at the Linux Foundation. "This interactive resource has been a labor of love from and for our community, and I look forward to watching it grow into the same standard for real-time ecosystem information that the CNCF Landscape has been for the cloud native space."

GraphQL is a next­-generation API technology developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly [open sourced in 2015](https://code.fb.com/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/). Unlike REST-­based APIs, which take advantage of HTTP and existing protocols, GraphQL APIs provide developers with the flexibility to query the exact data they need from a diverse set of cloud data sources, with less code, greater performance and security, and a faster development cycle. Not only does this enable developers to rapidly build top­ quality apps, it also helps them achieve consistency and feature parity across multiple platforms such as web, iOS, Android, and embedded and IoT applications.

Brian Warner of The Linux Foundation has joined the GraphQL Foundation as its Program Director, helping to support the growing community and the project's ongoing needs. "I look forward to working with Lee and the governing board to establish the infrastructure and support needed to ensure the health and sustainability of the vibrant GraphQL community."

GraphQL is being used in production by a [variety of high scale companies](https://graphql.org/users/) such as Airbnb, Atlassian, Audi, CNBC, GitHub, Major League Soccer, Netflix, Shopify, The New York Times, Twitter, Pinterest and Yelp. GraphQL also [powers hundreds of billions of API calls a day at Facebook](https://code.fb.com/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/).
