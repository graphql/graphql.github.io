The GraphQL Foundation is thrilled to announce significant updates to our
Community Grant Program, now more streamlined and aligned with the foundation's
core projects!

## Improved process

We've revamped the application process to accept submissions
year-round, ensuring your innovative ideas get the attention they deserve
promptly. Our focus is sharper than ever, with grants specifically aimed at
projects tied closely to the GraphQL Foundation's efforts, including
code and documentation contributions to [our repositories on
GitHub](https://github.com/graphql) and enhancements to the
[graphql.org](https://graphql.org) website.

Rather than our previous twice-annual review process, our new process will
perform basic appropriateness checks on a much higher cadence, and will pass
suitable applications to the TSC for review. This should result in faster
turnaround times, ensuring that your critical work gets the support it needs
when it needs it!

## Apply now!

Whether it's completing an important RFC task, polishing a major pull request,
educating users with excellent content and documentation, engaging in community
advocacy, or improving the user experience on our platforms, we're looking for
your unique contributions. Don't miss this chance to make an impact on the
GraphQL ecosystem.
