_The inaugural event for the GraphQL Foundation, GraphQLConf, delivers the best GraphQL content available._

**SAN FRANCISCO, August 24, 2023** – The GraphQL Foundation, dedicated to promoting widespread adoption and accelerating development of the surrounding ecosystem, today announced the schedule for [GraphQLConf 2023](https://graphql.org/conf/). The conference will be held in the San Francisco Bay area, CA, September 19-21, 2023.

GraphQLConf brings together the creators of some of the most important technologies behind GraphQL. Speakers from a wide range of organizations working with GraphQL at enterprise scale will share their experience, insights and knowledge as they discuss the challenges facing the growing GraphQL ecosystem. The program was developed by a community-led committee, which selected over 60 sessions after an open CFP that produced a large and diverse set of submissions that span topics from technical challenges and deep dives to end-user stories and introductory content.

“This event is a truly special moment for the GraphQL community,” said Lee Byron, Co-creator of GraphQL and Executive Director of the GraphQL Foundation. “GraphQLConf is the only vendor-agnostic, community-focused conference for developers. We’re thrilled to bring everyone together and celebrate big milestones for our projects and the spec.”

The GraphQLConf community-curated [schedule](https://graphql.org/conf/schedule/) will feature talks from leaders in the industry, and will focus on the most important and relevant topics facing the ecosystem, such as new specifications and features, GraphQL Gateways, GraphQL Security, interoperability between GraphQL and other API protocols, Generative AI and GraphQL performance, caching and no-code tools.

Keynote sessions from developer-entrepreneurs Idit Levine, Marc-Andre Giroux, Tanmai Gopal, and Theo Browne will be featured, along with workshops and breakout sessions on using GraphQL across tech stacks, languages, and deployment technologies. There will also be community-driven unconference sessions held on Sept. 19.
