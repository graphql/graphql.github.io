We are pleased to announce the results of this year's GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC) elections. Every year, five of the ten TSC seats are up for election, and this year has seen some changes in the committee lineup.

## Outgoing Member: Marc-André Giroux

Firstly, we would like to extend our gratitude to [Marc-André Giroux](https://github.com/xuorig), who chose not to seek re–election this year. Marc-André has been a valuable member of the TSC, contributing significantly to the GraphQL ecosystem. We appreciate his dedication to the GraphQL Foundation!

## Continuing Members: Benjie Gillam, Ivan Goncharov, Matt Mohoney, and Michael Staib

We are pleased to announce that the four other TSC members whose seats were up for election — [Benjie Gillam](https://github.com/benjie), [Ivan Goncharov](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov), [Matt Mohoney](https://github.com/mjmahone), and [Michael Staib](https://github.com/michaelstaib) — have been re–elected and will continue to serve on the TSC. Their ongoing commitment and expertise will undoubtedly contribute to the continued success of GraphQL.

## Welcoming Denis Badurina

Joining the TSC this year is [Denis Badurina](https://github.com/enisdenjo), who will be filling the seat vacated by Marc-André Giroux. You may know Denis from his work on the `graphql-http` project, the reference implementation of GraphQL-over-HTTP and a test suite to help ensure compliance across all the servers in the ecosystem. Denis brings a wealth of experience and a fresh perspective to the committee, and we look forward to working with him to shape the future of GraphQL.

## About the GraphQL TSC

Composed of ten elected members and led by Executive Director Lee Byron, the [GraphQL Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md) is responsible for technical oversight for all of the GraphQL Foundation's open source projects, both software and specifications. However, we believe in the power of collaboration and recognize that impactful contributions can come from all corners of our community. While the TSC plays a crucial role in overseeing the technical aspects of our projects, we want to emphasize that one doesn't need to be a TSC member to make a significant impact.

We actively encourage working groups to manage themselves autonomously, fostering a sense of ownership and innovation within each group. The TSC is here to provide support and guidance, and to perform administrative actions that cannot be delegated. We value the diverse talents and expertise within our community, and we believe that every individual has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the success of our projects.

## Expressing Gratitude

We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who participated in the election process, especially the candidates who stepped forward — your involvement is vital to the success of the GraphQL ecosystem.

## Looking Ahead

As we move forward, the GraphQL TSC remains dedicated to fostering collaboration, inclusivity, and technical excellence within the GraphQL community. We are excited about the future of GraphQL and the continued impact it will have on API development and beyond; if you're interested in helping us on this mission then [get involved in the GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/JoiningAMeeting.md) and maybe even consider nominating yourself for a TSC position in the December election!
