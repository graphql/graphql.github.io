The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use [Express](https://expressjs.com), a popular web application framework for Node.js. You will need to install two additional dependencies:

```bash
npm install express graphql-http graphql ruru --save
```

Let's modify our “hello world” example so that it's an API server rather than a script that runs a single query. We can use the 'express' module to run a webserver, and instead of executing a query directly with the `graphql` function, we can use the `graphql-http` library to mount a GraphQL API server on the “/graphql” HTTP endpoint:

```js
var express = require("express")
var { createHandler } = require("graphql-http/lib/use/express")
var { buildSchema } = require("graphql")
var { ruruHTML } = require("ruru/server")

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
var schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`)

// The root provides a resolver function for each API endpoint
var root = {
  hello() {
    return "Hello world!"
  },
}

var app = express()

// Create and use the GraphQL handler.
app.all(
  "/graphql",
  createHandler({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: root,
  })
)

// Serve the GraphiQL IDE.
app.get("/", (_req, res) => {
  res.type("html")
  res.end(ruruHTML({ endpoint: "/graphql" }))
})

// Start the server at port
app.listen(4000)
console.log("Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql")
```

You can run this GraphQL server with:

```sh
node server.js
```

You can use the Graph_i_QL IDE tool to issue GraphQL queries directly in the browser. If you navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), you should see an interface that lets you enter queries.

At this point you have learned how to run a GraphQL server. The next step is to learn how to [issue GraphQL queries from client code](/graphql-js/graphql-clients/).
