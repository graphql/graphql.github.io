## How GraphQL is developed

At its core, the GraphQL project is organized around the [specification](https://spec.graphql.org), with a wide variety of supporting implementations and tools.

GraphQL has an active and mutually beneficial relationship with its many implementations. The GraphQL specification is continuously evolving under the care of the [GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg), which consists of GraphQL spec experts, contributors to public [reference implementations](/code/), and implementers. At any given time, GraphQL specification updates are a combination of anticipatory planning with documentation of patterns and behaviors that are already proven in production, sometimes at very large scale.

### Working groups

The GraphQL specification, sub-specifications, and official reference implementations are developed using the working group model. The working groups meet monthly or as-needed in order to review ideas and plan their work.

#### The GraphQL Working Group

The [GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) is the main group that plans and implements changes to the [GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org). It meets actively and is the default place for discussion for topics which do not have a separate breakout working group (breakout working groups include the [Input Union WG](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/rfcs/InputUnion.md) and the [GraphQL-over-HTTP WG](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http)).

- **GitHub**: [github.com/graphql/graphql-wg](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg)
- **Meeting frequency:** Monthly, generally the first Thursday ([calendar](https://calendar.graphql.org))
- **Agenda:** [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/agendas)
- **Recordings:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foH30_sDnEZnxV_8pYW3SDtb)

#### GraphQL.js Working Group

The [GraphQL.js Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg) works on one of the main reference implementations, [graphql.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

- **GitHub**: [github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg)
- **Meeting frequency:** Monthly, generally the last Wednedsay ([calendar](https://calendar.graphql.org))
- **Agenda:** [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/tree/main/agendas)
- **Recordings:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foHghwopNuQM7weyP5jR147I)

If you would like to set up a working group around a specific topic, please join a [GraphQL Working Group meeting](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) and present your idea.
