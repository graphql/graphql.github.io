# GraphQL Local Initiative

The GraphQL Foundation's primary mission is to ensure the continued evolution of
the GraphQL specification and reference implementations. As part of this
mission, we strive to provide collaboration infrastructure that fosters a
culture of community and innovation. Local get-togethers play a crucial role in
this, bringing together developers, library maintainers, vendors, and
enthusiasts to share knowledge and collaborate.

To better support these meets and clarify the process, we are excited to
announce the official **GraphQL Local** initiative. This initiative provides a
framework for organizing local GraphQL user groups and offers support to each
approved group (hereafter, a "Local").

We're happy to support both new and existing GraphQL meets; here’s what you
need to know to get involved:

## Requirements

Organizers of a Local must agree:

- All official events and related channels will be governed by the
  **[GraphQL Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/)**.
- Official communications will comply with the
  **[GraphQL Brand Guidelines](https://graphql.org/brand/)**.
- The Local accepts **GraphQL TSC oversight**:
  - At least one
    [GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC) member](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-members)
    must be granted administrator access to the Local’s online platforms (we
    will assign a TSC member and supply the relevant details on approval of
    your Local).
  - In case of a serious Code of Conduct breach, an organizer may be replaced.
- The Local has 1 or more organizer from the area. (We're pretty flexible on the
  definition of "from the area", just be reasonable.)
- Each official event will have at least least one **organizer present**.
- Official events will be held in an appropriate **professional setting**.
- Official events will feature at least one GraphQL-related talk (the format can
  vary: lecture, lightning talk, panel, AMA, etc).
- These **talks will be recorded** and made freely available online.
- Official events will be be **announced at least two weeks in advance**.
  Popular ticketing platforms include Eventbrite, Guild.host, and Meetup.com.
- Attending official events will be **affordable**.
  - If not free, attendance fees must not exceed USD $10 or local equivalent
    without explicit approval from the GraphQL Marketing and Content committee.
    Events charging fees waive their entitlement to GraphQL Foundation
    sponsorship.
- Organizers will **report back on attendance**, general feedback, and any
  suggestions for future events in a timely manner.

Groups may of course organize other events, e.g. a summer barbeque, but these
are currently out-of-scope of GraphQL Foundation support. These other events
shall not be referred to as "official", but are still encouraged to follow the
guidelines that are applicable (in particular, the Code of Conduct and Brand
Guidelines must still be honoured).

## Support

Each approved Local is entitled to request the following support for each
event:

- **Sponsorship** up to USD $200 per event (max 1 per quarter) for approved
  costs (see below). More sponsorship might be available directly from
  individual foundation members, see details below.
- **Swag bundle**\* to distribute to speakers, attendees, or organizers (max 1
  per quarter).
- **Google Slides templates** for:
  - Code of Conduct
  - Call for Papers (CFP)
  - Sponsors
  - Schedule
  - Speaker/talk introduction
- **Promotion** through GraphQL’s Twitter and LinkedIn channels.
- **Local artwork** adhering to the GraphQL Brand Guidelines; including
  avatars, event banners, and slide templates. \*\*

\* The content of swag bundles may change from time to time depending on
available inventory.

\*\* There may be a significant delay on the delivery of local artwork
currently, we're still figuring out designs.

## Approved Costs

Sponsorship funds may be used towards:

- Food (be sure to consider dietary restrictions and allergies)
- Non-alcoholic drinks (alcoholic beverages, if provided, require sponsor
  approval or should be paid out of alternative funds)
- Venue hire
- Swag for speakers or attendees
- Promotional materials
- AV resources (e.g., camera stand, microphone)

On approval of your GraphQL Local you will be provided with invoicing
instructions.

## Caveats

All support is subject to the finite resources (both financial and temporal) of
the GraphQL Local initiative. Sponsorship may be adjusted both up and down based
on expected attendance and is discretionary. Bespoke work, e.g. local artwork,
may have long and unpredictable lead times. Your application may be declined for
any reason, but in particular if we think it is likely that the initiative will
exhaust its budget we will decline all further applications until more budget
becomes available.

If you'd like to help support the GraphQL Foundation's various programs and
initiatives, consider becoming a GraphQL Foundation member.

## Additional Support

If you need extra support for your event (e.g., transportation costs or higher
venue fees/larger food and drinks budget for larger get-togethers), individual
GraphQL Foundation member organizations may be able to offer additional support,
often with a small ask such as saying a few words about them during the event.
If your gathering is approved, you will be provided with contact information for
member organizations who have expressed interest in supporting gatherings.
