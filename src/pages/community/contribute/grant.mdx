# Community Grant Program

The [GraphQL Foundation](/foundation) funds a [Community Grant](/foundation/community-grant) program that is administered by the [GraphQL TSC](/community/contribute/governance/#technical-governance). The goal of the community grant program is to provide support to individuals working on initiatives that benefit the core technical project and the community at large.
