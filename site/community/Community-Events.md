## Talks

### High Performance GraphQL

- **Event:** ReactNext 2016
- **Date:** September 15, 2016
- **Location:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada
- **Speaker:** Barak Chamo
- **Link:** http://react-next.com/#schedule

DataLoader is the missing piece in the React-Relay-GraphQL stack, a utility for caching and coalescing data queries to optimize large, nested GraphQL queries. Digging through it's internals and in turn, JavaScript's internal asynchronous model, we'll see how DataLoader leverages Node's event loop and micro task management to coalesce database calls and dramatically improve upon caveats in common GraphQL-based apps.

### Angular Meets GraphQL
