## Upcoming Events

### Building better apps with GraphQL

- **Event:** GraphQL London #1 Meetup
- **Date:** November 29, 2016
- **Location:** London, UK
- **Speaker:** Martijn Walraven
- **Link:** https://www.meetup.com/GraphQL-London/events/235489110/

Martijn Walraven is a developer on the Apollo Open Source team at Meteor, where he focuses on bringing GraphQL to mobile developers. He created a strongly typed GraphQL client for iOS written in Swift, and is working on doing the same for Android. He'll briefly introduce GraphQL and how it is a product-developer-friendly and efficient method for fetching structured data from a server, designed to be an alternative to REST. In this talk, heâ€™ll explain why GraphQL was developed, how it works, and how you can use it in your own apps, whether you are a React (Native), Angular, or native iOS or Android developer.
