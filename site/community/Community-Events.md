We'd like to share KLM and Bynder experience working on GraphQL based applications that thousands of people are using every day. Beyond basics we'll discuss: persistent queries (query whitelisting and reduced bandwidth usage); optimistic UI (make the interface respond faster); connecting React components to GraphQL with wrappers (improvements beyond default Apollo frontend implementation)... and the cherry on the cake: GraphQL Subscriptions.
