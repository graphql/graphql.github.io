## Talks

### High Performance GraphQL

- **Event:** ReactNext 2016
- **Date:** September 15, 2016
- **Location:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada
- **Speaker:** Barak Chamo
- **Link:** http://react-next.com/#schedule

DataLoader is the missing piece in the React-Relay-GraphQL stack, a utility for caching and coalescing data queries to optimize large, nested GraphQL queries. Digging through it's internals and in turn, JavaScript's internal asynchronous model, we'll see how DataLoader leverages Node's event loop and micro task management to coalesce database calls and dramatically improve upon caveats in common GraphQL-based apps.

### Angular Meets GraphQL

- **Event:** AngularZone Meetup
- **Date:** September 18, 2016
- **Location:** London, UK

Uri Goldshtein works at Meteor Development group at the Apollo team and is the creator of the angular-meteor and angular2-apollo libraries. In this talk you will learn what GraphQL is, why it is great for Angular and how easy it is to integrate with your current Applications. GraphQL has many benefits comparing to REST like better performance over the network and maintainability. Use this opportunity to ask him questions about this topic before his talk at AngularConnect!

### From REST to GraphQL
