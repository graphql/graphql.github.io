### Groovy 

#### [gorm-graphql](https://github.com/grails/gorm-graphql/)

**Core Library** - The GORM GraphQL library provides functionality to generate a GraphQL schema based on your GORM entities. In addition to mapping domain classes to a GraphQL schema, the core library also provides default implementations of "data fetchers" to query, update, and delete data through executions of the schema.

**Grails Plugin** - In a addition to the Core Library, the GORM GraphQL Grails Plugin: 

- Provides a controller to receive and respond to GraphQL requests through HTTP, based on their guidelines.
- Generates the schema at startup with spring bean configuration to make it easy to extend.
- Includes a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) browser enabled by default in development. The browser is accessible at /graphql/browser.
- Overrides the default data binder to use the data binding provided by Grails
- Provides a [trait](https://grails.github.io/gorm-graphql/latest/api/org/grails/gorm/graphql/plugin/testing/GraphQLSpec.html) to make integration testing of your GraphQL endpoints easier

See [the documentation](https://grails.github.io/gorm-graphql/latest/guide/index.html) for more information.

        SchemaParser schemaParser = new SchemaParser();
        TypeDefinitionRegistry typeDefinitionRegistry = schemaParser.parse(schema);

        RuntimeWiring runtimeWiring = newRuntimeWiring()
                .type("Query", builder -> builder.dataFetcher("hello", new StaticDataFetcher("world")))
                .build();

        SchemaGenerator schemaGenerator = new SchemaGenerator();
        GraphQLSchema graphQLSchema = schemaGenerator.makeExecutableSchema(typeDefinitionRegistry, runtimeWiring);

        GraphQL build = GraphQL.newGraphQL(graphQLSchema).build();
        ExecutionResult executionResult = build.execute("{hello}");

        System.out.println(executionResult.getData().toString());

var graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql');
var { buildSchema } = require('graphql');

var schema = buildSchema(\`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
\`);

var root = { hello: () => 'Hello world!' };

var app = express();
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({

\`\`\`bash
npm install apollo-server-express body-parser express graphql graphql-tools
\`\`\`

Then run \`node server.js\` with this code in \`server.js\`:

\`\`\`js
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var { graphqlExpress, graphiqlExpress } = require('apollo-server-express');
var { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools');

var typeDefs = [\`

  query: Query
}\`];

var resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello(root) {
      return 'world';
    }
